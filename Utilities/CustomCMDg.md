_I highly recommend reading this page to better understand what you are doing https://ss64.com/nt/prompt.html_

The windows cmd can be customized with the `prompt` command which has several variables.

## Variables available
The following (which can be used in the script):

```
 $A & (Ampersand) 
 
 $B | (pipe) 
 
 $C ( (Opening parenthesis) 
 
 $D Current date 
   
 $E Escape code (ASCII code 27) 
   
 $F ) (Closing parenthesis) 
   
 $G > (greater-than sign) 
   
 $H Backspace (erases previous character) 
   
 $L < (less-than sign)
   
 $N Current drive 
   
 $P Current drive and path 
   
 $Q = (equal sign) 
   
 $S (space) 
   
 $T Current time 
   
 $V Windows version number 
   
 $_ Carriage return and linefeed 
   
 $$ $ (dollar sign)
 ```
 
# Extras
There is no limit to the number of combinations for these, and they (probably) won't cause any errors in the system or the CMD in general.
 
There are also buttons for
