# Easy to use guide

_I highly recommend reading this page to better understand what you are doing https://ss64.com/nt/prompt.html_

The windows cmd can be customized with the `prompt` command which has several variables.

---

Each button says which variable it adds, just click on the ones you want.

In the text box you can delete whatever you want, but you cannot decide where the variable is written, it is always at the end of the text box (at least for now).

You can use the [Preview in CMD] button to see what the output will look like.

Finally using the [Apply] button, well... the style is applied, and it will look like this every time you open a new cmd.

If you want to undo that, click on [Reset CMD] button.

## Variables available
The following (which can be used in the script):

```
 $A & (Ampersand) 
 
 $B | (pipe) 
 
 $C ( (Opening parenthesis) 
 
 $D Current date 
   
 $E Escape code (ASCII code 27) 
   
 $F ) (Closing parenthesis) 
   
 $G > (greater-than sign) 
   
 $H Backspace (erases previous character) 
   
 $L < (less-than sign)
   
 $N Current drive 
   
 $P Current drive and path 
   
 $Q = (equal sign) 
   
 $S (space) 
   
 $T Current time 
   
 $V Windows version number 
   
 $_ Carriage return and linefeed 
   
 $$ $ (dollar sign)
 ```
 
# Extras
There is no limit to the number of combinations for these, and they (probably) won't cause any errors in the system or the CMD in general.
 
There are also buttons for

[Preview] [Apply] [Open a CMD] [Reset]
