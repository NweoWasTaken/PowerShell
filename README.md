# PowerShell repository

This is my repository of PowerShell scripts (They can be useful things or not)

Man i love ps ðŸ’™

## Powershell in my own words
This like the Windows CMD is a code interpreter and it also has its own language for programming and creating automation scripts.

***PowerShell is the CMD with sterodies and I love that***.

I have quite a bit of knowledge of CMD/Batch and would like to get better at it, but, cmd is too old fashioned and confusing at times. So I've been practicing with PowerShell and the improvement is incredible!

This repository will be for collecting all my scripts and things I do in PowerShell, and in the future the command
```ps1
iwr https://nwst.netlify.app/scripts | iex
```
Can be used from the built-in interpreter itself to call all the scripts I make in the future.
