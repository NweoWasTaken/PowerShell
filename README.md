Man i love ps üíô

## Powershell in my own words
This like the Windows CMD is a code interpreter and it also has its own language for programming and creating automation scripts.

***PowerShell is the CMD with sterodies and I love that***.

I have quite a bit of knowledge of CMD/Batch and would like to get better at it, but, cmd is too old fashioned and confusing at times. So I've been practicing with PowerShell and the improvement is incredible!

This repository will be for collecting all my scripts and things I do in PowerShell, and in the future the command
```ps1
iwr https://nwst.netlify.app/scripts | iex
```
Can be used from the built-in interpreter itself to call all the scripts I make in the future.

## Scripts
#### Funny
- [***‚è≤ Timer.ps1***](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NweoWasTaken/PowerShell/main/Funny/Timer.ps1) I made a timer in a single line of text and with 222(Now 185!) characters. Why?... Why not? lmao! I will update it soon to use even less characters!
#### Utilities
